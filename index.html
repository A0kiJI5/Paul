            <p>
                Nationality refers to an individual's legal membership or affiliation with a particular nation or country. It is often determined by a person's place of birth, naturalization, or other legal criteria established by a nation's government.
                Nationality is an important aspect of a person's identity, as it can have various legal, social, and cultural implications, including the rights and responsibilities one has within a specific country. Nationality can affect a person's ability to vote, work, access government services, and travel across international borders, among other things. It is distinct from ethnicity, which is related to a person's cultural and sometimes ancestral background.
